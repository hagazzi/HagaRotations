# Development of Rotation.

Thank you for joining the circle of rotation developers who have a role called `xxx dev` in [Discord](https://discord.gg/4fECHunam9). 

All the rotations should be developed by the players who have a certain understanding of the job, not me who doesn't.  I would like you to share your rotation with the public!

I'll make it easier and easier to develop a custom rotation.

## Core Concept

Find one 0GCD as the core burst action, and bind it to the `InBurst` property. Make all GCDs or 0GCDs bind to the status or cd of that burst 0GCD to align your rotation.

## Responsibility

- Basic
  - Maintain your rotation.
  - Answer the questions about your own rotation.
- Advanced
  - Maintain the action list.
  - Maintain the ID of action or status.
  - Raise the issue encountered in the development.

## Forum

This wiki isn't perfect right now. If you have any questions or suggestions, please talk about it on the `#rotation` channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/4fECHunam9) with a `xxx dev` role.
